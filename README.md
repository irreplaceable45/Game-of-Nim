# Game-of-Nim
Actually a game, used in explaining discrete maths course
Example: The Game of Nim 
We close this introductory chapter by returning to the roots of combinatorics in recreational mathematics and investigating the ancient game of Nim.  Its solution depends 
on parity, an important problem-solving concept in combinatorics. We used a simple 
parity argument in investigating perfect covers of chessboards when we showed that a 
board had to have an even number of squares to have a perfect cover with dominoes. 
Nim is a game played by two players with heaps of coins (or stones or beans). 
Suppose that there are k 2: 1 heaps of coins that contain, respectively, nl, n2,.' . , nk 
coins. The object of the game is to select the last coin. The rules of the game are as 
follows: 
(1) The players alternate turns (let us call the player who makes the first move I 
and then call the other player II). 
(2) Each player, when it is his or her turn, selects one of the heaps and removes at 
least one of the coins from the selected heap. (The player may take all of the 
coins from the selected heap, thereby leaving an empty heap, which is now "out 
of play.") 
The game ends when all the heaps are empty. The last player to make a move-that 
is, the player who takes the last coin(s)-is the winner. 
The variables in this game are the number k of heaps and the numbers nl, n2, ... , nk 
of coins in the heaps. The combinatorial problem is to determine whether the first or 
second player wins 14 and how that player should move in order to guarantee a win-a 
winning stmtegy.
